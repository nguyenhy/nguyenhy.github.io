## Introduction
Performance directly affects user experience: slow sites frustrate users, fast ones feel smooth and responsive. To improve performance, developers must understand not only how Javascript (JS) runs but also how browsers render pages.

Both JS execution and key parts of the rendering pipeline run on the browser’s **main thread**, which means heavy JS task can block rendering and vice versa. If heavy JS blocks it, rendering and user interaction are delayed. Understanding both sides explains why some apps feel “laggy” and others stay smooth.
